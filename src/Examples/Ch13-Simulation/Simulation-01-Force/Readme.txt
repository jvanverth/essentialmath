This demo implements a simple physical simulation using only linear forces. The cyan sphere is being pulled towards the origin by a spring.  It is also being affected by gravity and a slight drag force, as well as forces created by the user.  

Controls
--------

I,J,K,L: generate forces in the yz directions to pull the sphere around.
W,S: increase and decrease the spring force
SPACE:   resets demo
ESC, Q:  quit

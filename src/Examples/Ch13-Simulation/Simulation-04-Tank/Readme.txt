This example demonstrates some simple tank code.  The tank can be driven forward, backward,
turned, and turned in place.   The orange lines indicate the relative forces (they've 
been scaled down) used to drive the tank. The simulation code can be found in Player.cpp.

Controls
--------

I,K: move tank forward, back
J,L: turn tank left, right
SPACE:   resets demo
ESC:  quit

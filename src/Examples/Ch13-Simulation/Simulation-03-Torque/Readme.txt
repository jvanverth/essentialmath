This example demonstrates force-based simulation code, including both linear and angular 
factors.  Forces (show in orange) can be applied to the cube to move it and spin it around.
The simulation code itself can be found in the Player object.

Controls
--------

I,J,K,L: generate forces in the XY directions to pull the cube around.
SPACE:   resets demo
ESC, Q:  quit

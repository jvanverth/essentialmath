This demo shows the basics of vertex and index buffer-based rendering via a
custom shader, one that assigns a uniform-based color that is not compiled 
into the shader itself.

The key commands are:

i, k - translate in x
j, l - translate in y
u, o - rotate around z axis
p, ; - uniformly scale
Space - reset transforms

This code example shows interpolation between a set of four points using piecewise 
Hermite interpolation.  In this case, the Hermite curve is set up automatically using
the clamped spline method or a natural spline.

The orange curve shows the Hermite path, the red points the interpolating points, 
the yellow lines the tangents (incoming and outgoing) at each point.

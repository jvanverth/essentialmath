This example demonstrates two methods of merging 3-component lighting
with textures - modulation and "modulation with late add".  The latter
of these modes makes possible "overbright" or "plastic" specular
highlights when lighting is combined with texuring.

The key commands are:

i, k - translate in x
j, l - translate in y
Space - reset transforms
0, 1, 2 - set the distance attenuation (constant, linear, quadratic)
a, q - decrease/increase ambient component
s, w - decrease/increase diffuse component
d, e - decrease/increase specular component
x - use modulation with late add
c - use pure modulation

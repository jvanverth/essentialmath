This example is equivalent to the previous one, with the addition of two
independent  lights.  The controls can be targeted to each light as desired

The key commands are:

c - switch the current light to be controlled
i, k - translate in x
j, l - translate in y
Space - reset transforms
0, 1, 2 - set the distance attenuation (constant, linear, quadratic)
a, q - decrease/increase ambient component
s, w - decrease/increase diffuse component
d, e - decrease/increase specular component
